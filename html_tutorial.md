3. How to convert slim to html?
          
          I just did it using Codepen.io

          Start a new pen. Choosing Slim as your HTML Markdown language. Paste in your Slim - then click the view compiled               button in your HTML pane.

          You'll see the straight HTML version of your markup.

          You can then copy that out.
