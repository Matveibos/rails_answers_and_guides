### `Clean code -  Robert Martins`
      
      1. Code should be on one abstraction layer ( a = 1 + 1, MyClass.new(a) not a good idea)
      2. Law of demeter ( A knows B, B knows C, A shouldn't know about C)
      3. Priority for cleaning code( Tesh should passed, DRY, Show your intension, Less code, class, methods )
